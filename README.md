# PaperLife Alpha
A Python game in which you can build your own pen-like-drawn city!

# Origins
This game based on a game I have been playing during boring lessons in my high schools. I have been drawing a city (on the
back cover-page) which was made of simple buildings. There were like two rules:
* The larger the city is, the more money you have, the more buildings you can drawn!
* All the buildings have to be drawn with blue pen!
There was no fixed amount of money received from rents from these buildings I just made up some amount based on the number of 
citizens I currently had. As time went by, the simple buildings became more less simple and the city became as big as the whole
page I have been drawing on.

# Implementation
The game will be a ressemblance of the game mentioned above. The only difference is that the amount of money received from rents
will be fixed (but still based on the population) not random.

# What is implemented?
* Placement of new buildings on the play field
* Save/load system
* Population system (overtime increment, dependent on services provided by the city (food, police, hospitals, ...)
* Available buildings: Town Hall, Flat house #1, #2, #3
